# decision-support-app

The aim is to create a simple app that you can add lists of options to and then it returns a random item from the list for when you can't make a decision.

## Ideas
- save the options so that we don't have to type things in every time
- use DATA validation for any or all input (Rhian - Done, Mike - ?)
- add drinks menu based on venue chosen from list for ;) LOVE THIS IDEA MIKE! -  could add recommendations based on input so if they choose food it recommends restaurants nearby? 
- run loops the number of times the user asked to originally before checking if they want to add another option
- let user choose what categories they want to make a decision for (Rhian - done but need to validate input, Mike - )
- split functions out into seperate file and call it in (Rhian - Done)
- add user functionality so multiple people can have saved categories to access
